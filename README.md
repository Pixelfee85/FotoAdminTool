# FotoAdminTool

Student's project at HfG Schwaebisch Gmuend - IoT2 
(by Christina Rost, Jana Seemann & Marina Rost) 

We decided to write a tool for sorting pictures by time - so pics taken within a defined time will be put in a seperate subdirectory.
The goal was that pictures made around the same event will end up in the same directory. 
works fine if the scanned directory does not contain any subdirectories. 

looks like a simple filebrowser & creates thumbnails of the pics. drag&drop not yet included. 
problem is, when dir contains alot of pictures, it takes a while to show the thumbs, cause at the moment they are generated every time you load a dir.
